# Dotfiles
My personal dotfile collection, managed by [Gnu
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Who's it for?
Well, mostly me. I mean, they are *my* personal dotfiles after all. Anybody
else is welcome to try them out, however.

# Software

these dotfiles. I'm not apologizing for that, sorry.

## Styling Advice
A [neat

colors similar to your wallpaper:

1. Load wallpaper into gimp
1. Select image->mode->indexed, then generate
1. Open windows->dockable dialogs->colormap

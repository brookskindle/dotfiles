# Dotfiles
My personal dotfile collection, managed by [Gnu
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), and inspired by [xero's
dotfiles](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles).

## OS
My operating system is currently Arch linux

## Pacman
Additionally, the list of applications I use is in `pacman_qqn.txt` and
`pacman_qqm.txt`, which list the output of `pacman -Qqn` and `pacman -Qqm`,
respectively.
